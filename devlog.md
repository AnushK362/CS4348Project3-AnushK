This devlog is going to track my thoughts and ideas for this project. This project involves b trees and the allocation of nodes in memory. The project gives a specific layout of how data is supposed to stored in the index file which is our container. 
In addition, I think the most difficult part of the project will be ensuring the b tree is maintaing its propoerty while keeping track of the connections between the different nodes. 

I am planning on first developing the basic creation of the index file and ensuring the format is how I want. Only after this is done, will I start on the CLI functionality for the different commands. Before I start coding, I am going to look into using different hex editors to view the index file.
This will help a lot with debugging as I progress. Next, I will organize the different componenets of the index file and make each componenet its own class. After I do this, I will figure out the next phase that I want to pursue in developing this program.

I realized that before the components, I need to do the check for big endian and handle it in the appropiate scenarios. In addition, I realized I need to make a class for the node that will contain all the attributes for the node.

I have started to implemnt the different componenets of the index file. I initally ran into the poroblem of understanding how values are organized in the format of the index file, but I think I have a better understanding now. In addition, I struggled to figure out the cases and checks for the big endian condition, but once again I think I have covered my bases. I have finished the header, and next session I am going to work on the node class. However, I will only learn if its correct once I get to working on the main method, where I can start with a basic flow to test what I have. Overall, I would say that I accomplished my goal for this session even though I did not finish as I better understand the scope of the project. In addition, I also understand more on how to use python to manipulate the bytes based on the section of output. Next session, I am going to continue to work on the Node path and hopefuly flesh out enough of the program so that I can test. Final note, I am working in a seperate branch call "dev".

After thinking about the project, I realized the node class needs to be more in depth than the header class as it has to store B-Tree information. In addition, I need to make sure I account for the sequence and size of the different sections within the node class. This session, my plan is to complete the node class and start on the different functions I will need to update node information. I need to make sure that the information is not being written into the incorrect spcaes and that the byte constraints are still being maintained as changes are made to the index file. I think to do this I am going to use loops within the node class to make sure the constraints of the different sections are being maintained. After I complete this, then I will flesh out a main method so that I can test the basic functionality of this program before I move on to the CLI commands.

I finished the node class and used loops to make sure the I am following the correct output. Now, I am going to start on the basic functionality helper functions that I will need to complete the more complex CLI functionality. I was able to get thorugh the basic helper methods I think I will need. Now I am going to do a simple main program to test what I have currently. I had some errors with incosistent variable naming so I had to fix this. I have implemented the create CLI command and that is working properly as it is creating the index file.

That was a productive session. I was able to finish the header class and basic helper method functionality and then test the base for the program. Currently I am working on the b-tree functionality, but I am optimistic that I am covering the different cases and maintaing the rules of the b-tree. I ran into some problem with naming, but I was able to resolve those. I also ran into the initial problem of how I was going to implement the insert functionality. I realized that I am going to need two seperate functions for the insert, one for when a node is not full and the other function to drive the insertion process. The second insert function is what I will work on in the next session. I will also work on the rest of the b-tree functionality in a new branch "B-Tree Func" in the next session. Overall, I accomplished my goal of completing the header and basic helper method functionality. In addition, I also started on the b-tree functionality which I will continue in the next session. One more note, is that main only handles the create command for now, this will be implemented later.

After thinking about the project, I realized that I am going to need more b-tree functions then I had initially expected. The reason for this is because of the balancing and ordered nature of the b-tree. This session I plan to continue developing the different functions for the b-tree implementation. Like I mentioned in the previous entry, I plan on working on these functions in a new branch called "B-Tree Func". I might need to change some methods, but overall I think I have a clear idea of the different components that are needed. In addition, I need to be careful when it comes to implementing the insertion of a node as there are several different cases to consider. I am thinking of abstracting the different cases into there own method so that it will be easier to integrate and connect with the other components of the program. Overall, my goal for this session is to finish implementing the B-Tree functionality.

I have implemented the different insert functions. It turns out that beyond the insert, I do not need to add more functions for the b-tree implementation. Initially, I thought I would need to make additional methods to verify if the format of insertion into the index is matching the specifications, however upon further thought it seems unnecessary. Later I will test the b-tree implementation as a part of the larger program testing. Next, I need to implement a search methodology for the search command. I am thinking of using a inorder traversal for the search as it works really well with b-trees. This will be my first implementation for the search and I believe the inorder method will work the best. For the inorder, I am going to use a list that stores 2-tuples which contain the information I need for this program. I finished the inorder traversal, now I want to test the entire implementation that I have. But first I need to make the appropiate methods to handle the different commands that the program will accept. I have now finished integrating the methods needed for the CLI. The last step before I begin the testing session is the integration of the different methods into the main method. I realized that I needed to make my node class a dataclass, I forgot to do that before the node class. I have started testing the entire application, testing one command at a time. I ran into some issues testing the search command, as I did not handle the 3-tuple in my searchOperation function. I rearranged the variables in the problematic portion and now it is working. I have tested all the commands and at a basic level they all seem to work. I opened the index file in an external editor and inspected the format and the hex values. After inspecting index, upon first glance the values seem to be stored correctly.

This was a long but very productive session. Not only was I able to finish the bk-tree functionality, but I was also able to implement the command functionality and integrate with the main method. I ran into some extra problem with the load command/operation, but I realized that I was not handling the file format properly (transition from csv to index). In addition, I was also able test the different commands and debug the different issues that I was having. At a basic level all the commands are working, however rigorous testing is still needed especially for edge cases. Next session will be solely dedicated to debugging and understanding if the output I am getting is truly right. For now, I will test in this current branch and only merge to main once I am condfident that the entire program is working. Overall, I am happy that I completed the goal for this session and also with the progress that I have made. The next step is thinking of comprehensive ways to test the program.

I am happy with the current state of the project. I was thinking about how I can test the program effecitveley in terms of input and b-tree structure. This session I plan to debug the program and test the entire functionality. I might also change some variable names to make them more clear in terms of their purpose. Some of the naming can be clarified more. In addition, I have an idea of what input is needed to also check the edge cases for the program. Overall, my goal is to thoroughly test the program and submit it.

Overall, the testing went well. I tested every command and all of them work. I did change a few variable names and strings, but not too much. In addition, I inspected the resulting hex file to see if I was getting the correct values and indeed the correct values were in the index file. My final plan of action, is to merge my final changes to main and submit the project. Throughout, the course of the project I feel I have gotten a better understanding of b-trees and python. Overall, I believe that I have completed the goal for this session and the entire project. Before submission, I will also modify the README as needed so that the grader can see how I ran the program. 

I made some last minute variable/comment changes after submission, but I resubmitted. No functionality changed.
