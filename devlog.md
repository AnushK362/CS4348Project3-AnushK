This devlog is going to track my thoughts and ideas for this project. This project involves b trees and the allocation of nodes in memory. The project gives a specific layout of how data is supposed to stored in the index file which is our container. 
In addition, I think the most difficult part of the project will be ensuring the b tree is maintaing its propoerty while keeping track of the connections between the different nodes. 

I am planning on first developing the basic creation of the index file and ensuring the format is how I want. Only after this is done, will I start on the CLI functionality for the different commands. Before I start coding, I am going to look into using different hex editors to view the index file.
This will help a lot with debugging as I progress. Next, I will organize the different componenets of the index file and make each componenet its own class. After I do this, I will figure out the next phase that I want to pursue in developing this program.
